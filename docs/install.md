You can install motionia.js via npm or right through `CDN`.

Motionia.js is very tiny in size and can be further reduced in size using cleancss at the build time.

## Using NPM

## Using CDN

You can place the motionia.js link inside the head of your document.

Here's how to do that:

```html

<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
        <meta name="" description="">
        <script src=""></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- here the main content goes.... -->
    </body>
</html>
```
