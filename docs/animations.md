Motionia.js is based on a new concept of using sets of  pre-built animations and comes with a easy customizable api's.

Motionia.js contains more than 40+ built in animations.These animations can be applied to any html para metric elements as well as thier attributes.

Unlike other animation javascript libraries , motionia.js doesn't require any tuning up nor it needs much to start with.

The animations can be customize easily to meet up the developer's requirements right through data-attributes or through utility classes refer Utilia.js that is built on top of motionia.js

Don't worry this library is created so as to make developer tasks easy and using pre built stuffs always saves a lot of developmental times.

This library often uses auto animation utility that is easily done when the browser renders the document.

Below list contains all the animations names that motionia.js conatins:

 - slide
